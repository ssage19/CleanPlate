        ### For All Programs:
        - **Be Professional**: Use business email, professional language

        - Don't oversell traffic numbers (be honest about current volume)
        - Don't rush follow-up emails (wait 1 week minimum)
        - Don't apply multiple times if rejected (wait 6 months)
